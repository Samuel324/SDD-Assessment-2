what got done: started log book 
on ver 1.2 tinkered with the character selection code, but just removed a character. (karol) forever missed
I have worked on this project at least 10 times prior but sinc ei didn't start the lof book (oops) it starts here,
the other stuff is mostly ascii art and me trying to build reference.


Date: 28 . 5 . 21 
I have restarted the game as it wasn't going in the direction I wanted it to.
i removed all the ascii art as it was annoying to work with

I have made multiple arrays and functions for my monsters and locations
